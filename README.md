# Hi, I'm Antonio 👋

Welcome to my portfolio.
## About Me
I am a Data Analyst skilled in Python automation, data cleaning, and visualization. I use Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Streamlit to automate data workflows and deliver insights. My background in Economics and Business Development has been applied in logistics, retail, and action sports.

Currently, I work at Globe Europe as a Sales Administrator and Analytics Specialist, managing sales data and providing analytics for the UK, Italy, and Benelux regions. I focus on automating business processes and supporting data-driven decisions.
